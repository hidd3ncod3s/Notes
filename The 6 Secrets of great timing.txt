1. When to launch that first product
2. When to ramp up scale
3. When to make the move into a new market.
4. When to pivot.

Timing - No single right approach but infinite bad ones.

Speed is King.

1. Timing is the riskiest thing a entrepreneur will face.
   Your amazing idea is good as your timing.

   GeneralMagic built an iphone 20 years earlier than Apple built it.
      Great idea but ahead of time.

   Is there an ecosystem for your new idea? 
   Entrepreneurs has to live in the future.

2. To time things right, bit of ignorance might help.
      Same idea is tried after many years , usually multiple times.
      Once failed, the same team will never try it.
      In the future, when a new team piches for a same old idea they usually don't know about the past failures.
      
      It is good to learn from the past, it is bad to be deterred by it.

3. Leverage your network to create a right timing.

4. If you wait until your idea is hot then you waited too late.
      Obviously good ideas are off the table.
      Which problem is more presonal to me ? (YC ask entrepreneurs to start company to solve their personal problem)
         Twitch cofounder - Justin
            - He wanted to become an influencer but there was no social platforms like twitter at that time.
