Masters of Scale - Marc Andreessen

1. When to launch that first product
2. When to ramp up scale
3. When to make the move into a new market.
4. When to pivot.

Timing - No single right approach but infinite bad ones.

Speed is King

1. Timing is the riskiest thing a entrepreneur will face.
   Your amazing idea is good as your timing.

   GeneralMagic built an iphone 20 years earlier than Apple built it.
      Great idea but ahead of time.

   Is there an ecosystem for your new idea? 
   Entrepreneurs has to live in the future.

2. To time things right, bit of ignorance might help.
      Same idea is tried after many years , usually multiple times.
      Once failed, the same team will never try it.
      In the future, when a new team piches for a same old idea they usually don't know about the past failures.
