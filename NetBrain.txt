Network dynamic mapping
	Layer2 mapping
	Layer3 mapping

Mean Time To Identify - MTTI

Goal is to reduce MTTI

hypothesis based troubleshooting
hypothesis based security - hunting

Dynamic mapping

Grabbing confs like forward networks?
	Adaptive Automation
	Grabbing information from CLI
	Parses information from basic CLI commands.
	Parse the output of the command and normalize the results.

Dynamic documentation

Three phases (Lifecycle of an Incident)
	Detect the problem 
	Identify the root cause of the problem
	Fix 

Solutions for detection
	24/7 monitoring
	Security information event management 

Solutions for reporting 
	Ticketing solutions

Identify phase
	Human open a ticket
	T1 person runs their runbook
	Idle time
	Find human to find the solution 
	Collaboration between them

Tribal knowledge 
Even a fresher has same level of knowledge as experienced about the network

Swifting knowledge to the left/west
	Swifting the knowledge of L3 engineer to L1 engineer.

A typical workflow goes from left to right
Starts from L1 to L2 to L3

Netbrain executable runbook
	- Document the troubleshooting process.
		- With that senior engineer will shift that workload to junior engineer.
			- What we get is automation and knowledge sharing.

Codify the steps the senior person take in the process of debugging.

Can provide recommended actions.

Golden baseline of your network.
	Golden baseline alert - deviation at field level.

Triggered Automation
	Automation trigger for servicenow ticket.
	Triggered on alert

	Diagnostic automation
		runbook
		Known problem diagnostic

Netbrain is platform for automation.

Given a servicenow ticket, it can fetch the text and extract
the important information like IP and collect all related 
information about that IP from the NetBrain data lake. So 
that the person who is looking into servicenow does not have
to do the same task again and again. 

Kind of enriching the ticket with the information NetBrain has.

Change Runbook
	Change Management module
	Special type of runbook
	Execute step
		Ticket snapshot before change
		Ticket snapshot after change.
	
Pushing the changes fast and "check" to make sure it does not break any 
production system.
