Cloud Networking for multi-cloud

MCNA - Multi Cloud Network Architecture

Each and every cloud is unique and propriatory.
	Their forwarding plane does not look like any other plane.

90% of enterprises are already multi-cloud

Abstraction over multiple cloud providers networking constructs.
	Visiblity of traffic between two endpoints.
	Azure/AWS/GCP/OCI

Multi-cloud networking and security platform for the enterprises.

Same but different
	Azure - vnet
	AWS   - VPC
	GCP   - Global Routing

Networking Constructs given by cloud providers are like Lego pieces.
	Users of lego has to apply their imagination to build it.

Aviatrix provides software platform.
	Platform with bunch of products and services in it.

1.2Gbps
	- Encryption limitation in the cloud.
	- You can use only one core in the instance.
		- That puts this limitation of 1.2G
	- Tunneling in the cloud is limited to 1.2G.
		- Tunnel between multiple clouds

Aviatrix can provide encryption upto 50Gbps

Cisco Architecture
	- Core ???
	- Aggregation layer ??


Why call this as Architecture ?
	- Want to push a process around it.

MCNA
	- Abstracts networking constructs.
	- You don't need to know the internals or differences of multiple cloud n/w architectures.
	- Two components
		- Aviatrix Controller - Brain
			- Instance in public cloud market place.
			- Management and core
			- Controller understands
				BGP
				SDR - Software Defined Routing
				Cloud APIs
		
		- Aviatrix Gateway
			- Distributed / Decoupled data plane across multiple cloud
			- EC2 appliance
				- Providing additional features that are not provided by the cloud providers
			
			- Why call it Gateway (not router) ?
				- Not just doing routing
				- Provides various function.
					- Basically you don't need to worry about missing feature by a single provider.
			
			- Embrace native constructs and provide additional features.
			
			- Assume you have multiple security group to manage the traffic between multiple VPC
			  then Aviatrix reduces the complexity in managing multiple SGs.
			  
			- Transit based architecture.
			
			- Enforcer
			
			- Can do routing/encryption/L4 firewall.
			
			- L7 firewall
				- Through partnership
					- PAN
					- Checkpoint
		
	- Repeatable architecture
	
	- You learn Aviatrix and deal with networking from multiple cloud providers.
	
	- Breakup of architecture
		- Three pillars
			1) Global multi-cloud networking / Networking
				- Common data plane
				- Repeatable architecture
				- key characteristics
					1. Common Consistent data plane.
					2. Principles are same for single or multple cloud
					3. Repeatable
			
			2) Security
				- Single vendor cannot meet all the security needs of a network architecture.
				- Features
					- Encryption between sites / VPC
					- Firewall
						- ingress/egress to VPC, not inside VPC
						- It's not easy to insert a firewall.
							- Not easy to use Active-Active nature of Firewall vendor
								- Equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP)
								- You have to enable the source NAT (SNAT) on the firewall to achieve this.	
							- Aviatrix Gateway provide load-balancing between the firewall.
								- Provides session stickiness
						- Two features
							- PCI compliance cannot be reached without L7 firewall.
							- Two types of firewalls
								- L4 firewall - inbuilt.
								- L7 firewall - partnership
							
				- Glue security functionalities.
					- Allow customers to bring in their existing products/policies.
						- It is already blessed by the audit team.
				
				- FQDN Egress filtering
				- Ingress routing features
					- Works with Guardduty (threat detection from AWS)
						- Gets the alert from Guardduty and act on that flow
				
				- VPN ??
					- Terminate VPN at the cloud
						- User VPN feature
							- SAML based
							- 2FA
								- Duo/Okta
				- Private S3 access through VIF
					- Direct connect to AWS S3
						- Required to open public VIF
							- AWS will give you the IP's addresses of S3 buckets
							  and you need to configure your on-prem device for that.
						- Aviatrix enables customers to access S3 buckets using private VIF
					
			3) Operations
				- On-prem
					- Operations team comes with familiar tools and estabilished best practices.
						- ping
						- traceroute
				
				- Cloud constructs take away the traditional tools. This will leads to ticket escalation.
					- Technically your L3 n/w architects are now treated as L1 operations persons.
						- Because we need 20-30 data points to debug this issue.
						
					- Lack of familiar troubleshooting tools
					
					- Cloud problems will take long time to solve n/w problems.
					
					- Aviatrix Controller has lot of troubleshooting tools.
						- flightpath tool from Aviatrix
							- Debugging
						
						- Reduces Mean Time To Resolution
						
						- Co-pilot tool
							- Visibility tool
							- Provides cloud network topology diagram
							- Information on traffic flow
				
				- Problem is same whether it is single cloud or multi-cloud


Eg,
Assume you have 10 VPC's and you dont want to use VPC Peering, and
if you use Aviatrix transists then traffic between those VPC's will be
handled by the Aviatrix Transists and provide additional features like
routing, traffic routing, L4 firewall and L7 firewall.

AWS TGW(Transit Gateway) orchestration
	- Limitation
		- Number of routes it can support

Metered licensing mechanism
